# Fake News Classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes

This project uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their headlines and text. The dataset used is from the Kaggle competition on [Fake News](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/overview) and consists of news articles labeled as "FAKE" or "REAL".

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- `fake_news_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- `fake_news.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

The project requires the following libraries to be installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `fake_news_classifier.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible platform.
3. Run the notebook cells to train and test the model.
4. The final model and its evaluation metrics will be displayed at the end of the notebook.

## Conclusion

The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm was used to classify news articles as either real or fake with an accuracy of around 87%. This model can be used to classify news articles and identify fake news with a high degree of accuracy.
